"""This is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed 
to detect open network ports and analyze suspicious URLs for phishing threats.
It‚Äôs powered by rule-based AI logic, without needing to train any machine learning 
models. It is lightweight, fast, and works entirely from the command line.


üí° Key Features:

üîç Port Scanner

Scans the first 1024 TCP ports on a target IP address

Identifies which ports are open and collects basic banner information

Assigns a risk level to each open port (High, Medium, Low)

üïµÔ∏è Phishing Detection

Analyzes URLs using intelligent heuristics:

Keyword detection (login, verify, bank, etc.)

Suspicious characters (like @ or -)

Length and structure of the URL

Gives a warning if the URL shows phishing behavior

üåç Geo IP & WHOIS Lookup

Retrieves geolocation data like:

City, country, ISP, and coordinates using ipinfo.io

Performs a WHOIS search on the domain to get:

Registrar, creation/expiry dates, and domain ownership details

üì¶ Full Report Generator

Automatically saves all results to a well-organized .json file

Includes port list, banners, phishing score, geo info, and WHOIS data

Helps security analysts and students understand attack surfaces

üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Python 3

socket for network scanning

re for regex-based phishing rules

requests for API calls

colorama for colored CLI output

python-whois for domain lookup

json for report saving
